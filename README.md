The Breach Bot gives information on the National Health Services 2017 Breach and the actions the organization took in order to put a stop to the breach. After telling the user about this breach, it will give the user a choice to either hear my reaction to the breach, the connection the breach had to the CIA Triad, or my advice on how to stay safe online. 

### Project
My project: 
- Identifies the details of a data breach and an organization's response.
- Loops or continues according to the user's decision. 
- Displays three reflections:  my reaction, the data breach's connection to the CIA Triad, and my advice for those online.
- Allows for the user to choose one choice: a, b, c.
- Loops until the user no longer wants to hear more about my perspective.
